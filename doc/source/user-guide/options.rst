HTML theme options
==================

In the Sphinx configuration (``conf.py``) file in the ``doc`` directory, you can use the
``html_theme_options`` dictionary to customize the Ansys Sphinx theme.

Show breadcrumbs
----------------

Showing breadcrumbs at the top of your documentation pages makes navigation easier.
Breadcrumbs are shown by setting ``"show_breadcrumbs": True``. To add additional
*root* breadcrumbs, ``"additional_breadcrumbs"`` is set to a list of tuples in
this form: ``("Link text", "url")``.

This ``html_theme_options`` dictionary show breadcrumbs, including a root breadcrumb
for the documentation landing page for the Ansys repository:

.. code:: python

   html_theme_options = {
       "github_url": "https://github.com/ansys/ansys-sphinx-theme",
       "show_prev_next": False,
       "show_breadcrumbs": True,
       "additional_breadcrumbs": [
           ("PyAnsys", "https://docs.pyansys.com/"),
       ],
   }

When you are on the landing page for your documentation, the breadcrumb shows the title for this
page. However, Sphinx cannot access this title from other documentation pages. Thus, after
``html_theme_options`` dictionary, you must set ``html_short_title`` to the display text to
use for this breadcrumb.

To ensure a consistent user experience, always set the ``html_short_title``
(or optionally ``html_title`` if ``html_short_title`` is not used) to the library name.

For example, in the ``conf.py`` file for the Ansys Sphinx Theme, this line is added
after the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary:

.. code:: python

   html_short_title = html_title = "Ansys Sphinx Theme"

If you want the title for your documentation's main ``index.rst`` file to show the version,
include ``|version|`` in the title:

.. code:: python

   html_short_title = html_title = "Ansys Sphinx Theme |version|"


Add and hide icons in the navigation bar
----------------------------------------

The navigation bar shows two icons on the right by default. The first is for
switching between light and dark modes. The second is for going to the library's
GitHub repository.

- For comprehensive information on adding custom link behavior, see
  `Add custom attributes to icon links <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/header-links.html#add-custom-attributes-to-icon-links>`_
  in the PyData Theme documentation.
- For comprehensive information on how to use Font Awesome to add icons, see `How To Add Icons <https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/web/add-icons/how-to>`_
  in the Font Awesome documentation.

The following sections explain how to add icons and hide icons.

Add icons
~~~~~~~~~

In the ``conf.py`` file, the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary has a child ``icon_links``
dictionary. To add icons to the navigation bar, add them to the ``icon_links``
dictionary. For each icon to add, specify its ``name``, the associated ``url``,
the ``icon``, and the ``type``.

This example adds an icon for sending an email:

.. code-block:: pycon

    html_theme_options = {
     "icon_links": [
         dict(name="Mail", url="mailto:me", icon="fas fa-envelope")
     ],
     ...
    }

Hide icons
~~~~~~~~~~

To hide icons so that they do not show in the navigation bar, add their names
to the ``hidden_icons`` dictionary:

.. code-block:: pycon

    html_theme_options = {
        "hidden_icons": ["GitHub"],
        ...
    }


If you want to hide all icons, use the ``show_icons`` Boolean variable:

.. code-block:: pycon

    html_theme_options = {
        "show_icons": False,
        ...
    }

Static search options
----------------------
The Ansys Sphinx theme supports static search options to customise your search bar.

The static search bar is created using ``Fuse.js``. You can provide all the options that are supported by ``Fuse.js`` through
the ``static_search`` dictionary in the ``html_theme_options``.

Additional options are:

#. ``keys``: List of keys to search in the documents. Default is ``["title", "text"]``.
#. ``threshold``: The minimum score a search result must have to be included in the results. Default is ``0.5``.
#. ``IgnoreLocation``: Whether to ignore the location of the search term in the document. Default is ``False``. This can reduce the search time for larger documents.
#. ``limit`` : The maximum number of search results to display. Default is ``10``.
#. ``min_chars_for_search``: The minimum number of characters to start the search. Default is ``1``.

.. note::

    All other options can be found in the `Fuse.js documentation <https://fusejs.io/api/options.html>`_.

Here is an example of how to add the ``static_search`` dictionary to the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme_options = {
        "static_search": {
            "threshold": 0.5,
            "limit": 10,
            "min_chars_for_search": 1,
        },
    }


.. note::

    To use the search bar in local documentation, you have to open the documentation in a local server.
    The search bar will not work if you open the HTML files directly in the browser.
    To open the documentation in a local server, run the following command in the directory where the HTML files are located:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -m http.server .

    Then, open the browser and go to ``http://localhost:8000``.


Cheat sheets
------------

If a cheat sheet has been created for your PyAnsys library, with ``quarto``, you can
add it to the left navigation pane of your documentation.

In the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary, you add a child dictionary named ``cheatsheet``
that contain these keys, in the order given:

#. ``file``: File name including the extension of the cheat sheet. If the file is inside a directory,
   include the directory name relative to the root of the documentation. For example, if the cheat sheet
   is in the ``getting_started`` directory, the file name is ``getting_started/cheat_sheet.qmd``.
#. ``title``: Title of the cheat sheet to be displayed in the left navigation pane.
#. ``pages``: List of names for the pages to include the cheat sheet on. If no value is provided,
   the cheat sheet is displayed only on the main ``index.html`` file.

Here is an example of how to add the ``cheatsheet`` dictionary to the `html_theme_options`` dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme_options = (
        {
            "cheatsheet": {
                "file": "<file name including the extension of the cheat sheet>",
                "pages": "<list of names for the pages to include the cheat sheet on>",  # Optional
            },
        },
    )

Here is an example of how to show a thumbnail of a PyMAPDL cheat sheet in the left navigation pane of its
main ``index.rst`` file and the ``learning.rst`` file in its "Getting started" section:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme_options = (
        {
            "cheatsheet": {
                "file": "getting_started/cheat_sheet.qmd",
                "pages": ["index", "getting_started/learning"],
            },
        },
    )

.. note::

    To use this feature, you must have the `quarto <https://quarto.org/>` package installed. To create thumbnails of generated PDF files,
    the theme is using `pdf2image`. So you should have the ``poppler`` package installed in your system.
    For more information, see the `pdf2image documentation <https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/>`_.
